    <h3>My Story...</h3>
    <p class="block">Born and raised in a small town called Lerum, just outside of Gothenburg. The early years was as for most kids, playing outside with friends doing all kinds of childish things. But my interest for technology was there, even as a kid and it has always been there for as far as I can remember.
        <br>
        <br> As a teenager most of my time was spent in front of a computer, either doing something productive or just playing games. I did play a game called "Day of Defeat" and was among the top players in Europe for some time. When I decided to retire from the scene my focus shifted to a game I am most certain you have heard of, World of Warcraft.
        <br>
        <br>I played it on and off for many many years. Since I was working the night shift at a hotel it was something that would keep me occupied during my days off, not falling asleep until morning is quite hard if you don't have anything to do. After 5 years of working night I made a decision to go back to school...
        <br>
        <br>For 2 years I studied network technology and IT-security and started to work as a consultant at Ericsson on the behalf of Sigma Young Talent. I was sure that I didn't want to go back to school, ever. I couldn't have been more wrong. My interest in other parts of the IT-world started to take the upper hand and I decided to once again hit the books. This time to become a front-end developer, and that is my story this far.
